    <div id="privacy_content"><h2>Privacy Policy</h2> <p> I, Will Said built the Mideo: Video + Listen to Music app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by
                        Will Said  and is intended for use as is.
                      </p> <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure
                        of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                      </p> <p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in
                        relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving
                        the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described
                        in this Privacy Policy.
                      </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                          For a better experience, and for remote debugging, Mideo may retain information about your device and how you use the app in a cloud database.
                          Mideo does not store any videos in the cloud, even for debugging purposes - every video taken by a user is only viewable on the device they take the video on.
                    </p>  <div> <ul>
                    </ul></p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p> The cloud database used for Mideo is secure to the greatest extent possible, but remember that no method of transmission over
                        the internet or any other method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable and thus cannot be guaranteed.
                      </p> <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p> <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect
                        personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child
                        under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete their data from
                        the servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal
                        information, please contact me.
                      </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p> I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
                        this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting
                        the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on
                        this page.
                      </p> <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p> <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact
                        me.
