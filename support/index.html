                                                    <li>Play music to a speaker (not headphones), and Mideo will be include the music in your video.</li>

                                                        <li>iPhones will not let any apps do this for privacy reasons. Think about it - if my app could listen in on the music playing from another app, I could also eavesdrop on ANY background audio or conversation! For this reason, Apple does not allow it.</li>
                                                        <li>The purpose of this app is to record videos without pausing the music - for example, I am a weightlifter, and I like to record my lifts while also listening to my favorite music.</li>

                                                    <li>Make sure you're not leaving the app when it's saving a long video (the app will say "Trimming" or "Saving") - this even includes swiping down to view your iPhone notifications or changing your music track.</li>
                                                    <li>Make sure you've allowed Mideo the permission to Read + Write to your Photos: go to the Settings app, scroll down to Mideo, and make sure the app is allowed to Read + Write.
                                                    <li>Make sure you have enough storage remaining on your iPhone: Mideo displays the "minutes remaining" within the app to give an estimate for how much storage you have left. You can free up storage by deleting long videos in the Photos app then making sure to delete them also from the "Recently Deleted" album.
                                                    <li>Have an iPad? Make sure you are using the most recent version of Mideo.</li>
                                                    <li>I recommend always using the red circle to record, not the volume buttons - some older devices have different functionalities for each.</li>
                                                    <li>Is it spinning forever and not saving? Restart your iPhone, that's a device error, not an app error.</li>
                                                    <li>Still not working? Then it's a device error, not an app error. Restart your device, and consider updating your iOS. If it still doesn't save, then you're one of the unlucky 0.01% of incompatible users - see the Refunds section at the bottom.</li>
                                                    <li>Email me (iam@willsaid.com) if you figure out what ended up fixing the issue for you, or if you can't figure it out!</li>

The “high” given by Apple corresponds to the highest available resolution, etc. This is what it’s like on an iPhone X:
